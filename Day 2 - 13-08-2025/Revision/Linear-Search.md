# Linear Search

Linear Search is defined as the searching algorithm where the list or dataset is traversed from one end to another to find the desired value. 

It works by sequentially checking on each element in the list until the desired value is found or the end of the list is reached

# Properties

- The worst case time complexity of linear search is O(n). In algorithm analysis the worst case time complexity represents the least efficient scenario. They are used to understand how the execution of an algorithm varies with different inputs.
- Linear search requires a constand amount of memory to run
- Linear search is efficient for small datasets but become inefficient for larger datasets. In practice , linear search is often used as a subroutine in some complex algorithms.
- It can be easily implemented using a loop with each iteration comparing the target value to the current element of the array.

# Application

- Phone book search - The algorithm can be used to search through a phone book to find a person's name.
- Spelll Checkers - The algorithm compares each word in the document to a dictionary of correctly spelled words until a match is found.
- finding min and max value - it can be used to find the min and max in an array or list
- useful for searching unsorted data

# Advantages

- Simplicity
- works with unsorted data
- low memory usage
- easy to debug

# Disadvantages

- Inefficient for large datasets
- Limited applicability
- no early termination - it does not have a mechanism to terminate early once the target element is found
- inefficient for sorted data
